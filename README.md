# MEASUREMENT CONVERSION DESKTOP APP

## Converts several measurements from one unit to another such as mass, length, temperature, molar units, and more.

The app gives a simple but beautiful interface for converting measurements from one unit to another with a dropdown list to
choose the unit to convert to/from. 
Use the app in the following steps:

* Select measurement to work in in the upper dropdown list

* Select unit to convert from in the left dropdown list

* select unit to convert to in the right dropdown list

* enter the value to convert from in the left input area

## How to Install
Installation and usage instructions (for end-users) - Now it’s time to get a little bit nerdier. If a user has gotten this far into your README, you bet there’s a chance they actually want to use your project. Give instructions on how to install or use the tool. Don’t get this confused with how to contribute to this project (like help improve the code), that’s the next section. This section should only talk about how to be a consumer of the project.


## How To Contribute
Installation and usage instructions (for contributors) - Ya know the best part of open source projects? If you make something really cool, others will want to help make it better! In this section of the README, give instructions on how to pull the code down and start up the tool for development purposes. This section is usually pretty technical and may require instruction on how to build from source, but hopefully, you have a script for MAKEFILE from stuff like that. Anything you can do to make the development experience easier will help you gain more contributors.


## Find a bug?
Contributor expectations - If you are looking for contributors, make sure you set the ground rules. There’s nothing worse than getting someone who wants to help you but they don’t know how! This section of the README gives the guidelines for contributions. Do you expect someone to create an issue in the issue queue and then resolve it with a pull request? Do you want squashed commits? Do you have a pull requests template? Explain it all here.


## Known Issues
Known issues - I already talked about this README section above so I’ll keep it short. Make a brief list of known issues here so people don’t report bugs you already know about!
